# AlgosProject
The primary goal is to design ,implement  and execute a experiment which need to fullfill the below requirments (as part of ITCS 6114 - Programming Project)  1) Comparison of various sorting algorithms of different complexity. 2) analysis by  test runs with large collection of numbers and collect time complexity metrics and generate graphs data(input collection data Vs time required to sort). 3)Implement a interactive active console which give a lot of options to perform this experiment multiple times on various large datasets. 4) Implement an efficient Longest Common subsequence LCS algorithm which utilizes the sort implementation in above steps.
